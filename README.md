Breaking the accessibility barriers for blind children

Hundreds of electronic games for children are existing nowadays and almost all require that users have good eyesight. But blind children are still children! They have right to happiness and to a quality life. Also, they seek for acceptance of their individuality and recognition of their increased needs for accessibility and autonomy.

LEAP Tic-Tac-Toe is a pc version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, especially modified for visually impaired people. It can be played solely with the use of audio. Note that the usage of headphones is mandatory. It is a [We are all citizens](http://www.weareallcitizens.gr/index_en.html) project, funded by [EEA grants](http://eeagrants.org) and [Bodossaki Foundation](http://www.bodossaki.gr/en/home).

## Current stable version
-------------------------
Current version is 1.1

## Extra Soundsets
------------------
You can add your own soundsets and allow people from all over the world to enjoy this game in their own language! Under the folder "Extra Soundsets" you will find the source code for a soundset manager created specifically to help you create soundsets for the leap tic-tac-toe game. Under the "compiled" folder you can also find compiled versions of the soundset manager for your convenience.

## Extra Soundsets Folder Structure
-----------------------------------
When creating a new build, if you want to support the usage of external soundsets, create a folder next to the games Data folder. The folder should have the same name but with the suffix Soundsets instead of the suffix Data (e.g. if building the project "tic-tac-toe_lin" create the folder "tic-tac-toe_lin_Soundsets" next to the folder "tic-tac-toe_lin_Data"). Directly under this folder add the compiled version of the soundset manager, the README.txt and sound_settings_TicTacToe.xml files from the src folder, and any soundset folders you want to include.
